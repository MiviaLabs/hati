Project is in development - it is not advisable to use it in production at this stage.

Feel free to play around and leave feedback :)

## What is that?

**Hati** gives you - out of the box - layer of communication for your distributed application or api, it has couple of integrations with different protocols which can be used for building your next project.

These integrations are:

- [x] Redis
- [ ] RabbitMQ
- [ ] P2P Protocol

## How does that work?

I'll tell you later :-)
